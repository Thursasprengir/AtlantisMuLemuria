 KLK_leftism:0 "Protect the Nirakshe"
 KLK_leftism_desc:0 "The Nirakshe, or the Expectation, is the duty every Indo-Lemurian citizen has of sharing the products of his work with the local community. We can't let the foreign individualist values undermine the very fabric of the people's morality with greed and selfishness!"

 KLK_olig_mil_1:0 "Hire Mercenaries"
 KLK_olig_mil_1_desc:0 "As distasteful as it may be, we must pass laws that will allow us to hire mercenary forces to enforce the will of the rightfully elected government of the people against rebels and treasonous nay-sayers."
 KLK_olig_center:0 "Deal with Dissent"
 KLK_olig_center_desc:0 "If we coopt one of our largest critics and give him a position with enough prestige and clout he might be willing to fall in line and help our cause."
 KLK_olig_cult_1:0 "Foreign Media Licensing"
 KLK_olig_cult_1_desc:0 "History has shown that the media conglomerates of the West have been very useful in spreading the 'Gospel of Wealth' which has allowed the rise of powerful industry and national stability. We should invite some of them in to help us with our growth."

 KLK_olig_mil_left:0 "American Arms Companies"
 KLK_olig_mil_left_desc:0 "Winchester, Smith & Wesson, and Colt are all American arms manufacturers that we should be trying to attract. If we provide favorable conditions for them to set up production lines they might help us to develop and build up our own arms companies."
 KLK_olig_mil_right:0 "Privatize Common Lands"
 KLK_olig_mil_right_desc:0 "They've served their purpose, but having large swaths of public lands in and around our cities is a terrible waste! By selling these lands to private companies we can grow and strengthen our economy. We can only hope that the people won't care about these sales."
 KLK_olig_cult_3:0 "Promote Consumerist Holidays"
 KLK_olig_cult_3_desc:0 "'Krismis', Valentine's Day and other consumer holidays appropriately promoted could bring a needed boost to our economy and give our people some much needed distraction. We don't have to be French to eat french toast."
 KLK_olig_final:0 "The Deep State"
 KLK_olig_final_desc:0 "The Lefitists continue to hide in the nooks and crannies of government just waiting for a chance to pop out and destroy us.

 KLK_stal_center_3:0 "Suppress the Syndicalists"
 KLK_stal_center_3_desc:0 "Mandalism is almost an acceptable path to socialism, but it is far too enmeshed with religious and parochial cultural concepts. By continuous education we can help the people to understand that Mandalism is a false system that is a counterfeit for True Socialism."

 KLK_stal_right_1:0 "The Ministry of Infrastructure"
 KLK_stal_right_1_desc:0 "Our nation is not united enough to allow the Revolution to flourish properly. By tying each region more closely together through infrastructure projects we can not only unite our people but employ them too!"
 KLK_stal_right_2:0 "Mass-Transit System"
 KLK_stal_right_2_desc:0 "To get our workers from Point A to Point B can be a real challenge. If we incorporate mass-transit systems into our urban development, and tie them in with inter-regional transport systems, we can ensure effective movement of troops and supplies to further  the Revolution!"
 KLK_stal_right_3:0 "Comrades Beyond the Seas"
 KLK_stal_right_3_desc:0 "Each nation must walk its own path toward the true goal, but some nations are closer to the path than others. By opening dialogues with small groups abroad we can help our socialist brothers and sisters abroad."
 KLK_stal_right_4:0 "Spreading the Revolution"

 KLK_synd_right_B:0 "The Old Empire"
 KLK_synd_right_B_desc:0 "Many dynasties have called Kumari Kandam home, but none have right to claim true and lasting governance over the people like the Mandalam. The rightful governors of the people, the people themselves, must determine their fate."
 KLK_synd_right_C:0 "The March Kings"
 KLK_synd_right_C_desc:0 "Each of the former lands of the ancient March Kings now holds a degenerate and corrupt system which oppresses its people. We must bring them back to an understanding of their roots."

 KLK_synd_center_right_1_desc:0 "Inspired by the 'Ateliers Nationaux' of the French Second Republic, the Pattaraikal are non-specialized factories where menial tasks are done.

 KLK_synd_center_right_2:0 "Improvised Arms Factories"
 KLK_synd_center_right_2_desc:0 "Almost anything can be made into a weapon, so by extension this means that almost any production line can be converted into making weapons for the defense of the people."
 KLK_synd_final:0 "The Red Kingdom"

 KLK_pop_1:0 "Women's Emancipation"
 KLK_pop_1_desc:0 "The women of our nation, while undisputed defenders of hearth and home, have not had a say in governance until now. We must right the wrongs of the past and bring Kalari women into the fold of politics and governance."

 KLK_quantity_desc:0 "Every man must be ready to fight for his nation! A large mass of men, even poorly equipped, can overcome even the most professional army."
 KLK_air:0 "Air Research"
 KLK_air_desc:0 "Armies are generally poorly armored against threats from the air - so we should put more weapons into the air!"
 KLK_quality_guns:0 "Weapon Modernization"
 KLK_quality_guns_desc:0 "Some of the older weapon designs, while familiar, suffer from some serious faults. We must put an increased focus on improving our weapons."
 KLK_quality_motor:0 "Motorized Support"
 KLK_quality_motor_desc:0 "A man on foot cannot move as far or as fast as a motorized transport. On top of that a single truck can carry more supplies than 500 men. By utilizing these motorized transports we can move men and materiel more effectively."

 KLK_quantity_cheap_ass_airplanes:0 "Purchase Foreign Airplanes"
 KLK_quantity_cheap_ass_airplanes_desc:0 "We do not have enough aircraft to truly fight our wars. We cannot construct enough to meet our needs, so we should purchase more from abroad."
