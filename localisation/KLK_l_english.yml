 KLK_main:0 "Encroaching Capitalists"
 KLK_main_desc:0 "The worldwide economic collapse has left us nearly defenseless against the corporate bullies and vultures of the world. Our economy must be strengthened to rebuff the rapacious capitalists!"
 KLK_oligarchy:0 "Invite the Companies"
 KLK_oligarchy_desc:0 "What better way to protect against the capitalists than to make them work for us? By creating carefully crafted regulations, but allowing significant freedoms, we can bring the capitalists to our shore on our terms."
 KLK_leftism:0 "Protect the Nirakshe"
 KLK_leftism_desc:0 "The Nirakshe, or the Expectation, is the duty every Indo-Lemurian citizen has of sharing the products of his work with the local community. We can't let the foreign individualist values undermine the very fabric of the people's morality with greed and selfishness!"
 KLK_oligarchy_2:0 "Deregulate the Industrial Sector"

 KLK_olig_cult_desc:0 "A word here, a billboard there, some judiciously applied bribes to political and cultural figures - this will be the most effective method of dealing with the national furore at the changes to our economic model."
 KLK_olig_mil_1:0 "Hire Mercenaries"
 KLK_olig_mil_1_desc:0 "As distasteful as it may be, we must pass laws that will allow us to hire mercenary forces to enforce the will of the rightfully elected government of the people against rebels and treasonous nay-sayers."
 KLK_olig_center:0 "Deal with Dissent"
 KLK_olig_center_desc:0 "If we coopt one of our largest critics and give him a position with enough prestige and clout he might be willing to fall in line and help our cause."
 KLK_olig_cult_1:0 "Foreign Media Licensing"
 KLK_olig_cult_1_desc:0 "History has shown that the media conglomerates of the West have been very useful in spreading the 'Gospel of Wealth' which has allowed the rise of powerful industry and national stability. We should invite some of them in to help us with our growth."
 KLK_olig_center_left:0 "Pass the Property Violation Act"
 KLK_olig_center_left_desc:0 "\"Any industrial owner whose property is found to be encroached upon shall have the right to demand satisfaction from the government not limited to, but including, the seizure of the real estate immediately abutting the encroached upon property.\""

 KLK_olig_cult_2_desc:0 "None of the media conglomerates is effective as those from America. Perhaps we can tempt some of them to bring their friendly media presence to our nation."
 KLK_olig_mil_left:0 "American Arms Companies"
 KLK_olig_mil_left_desc:0 "Winchester, Smith & Wesson, and Colt are all American arms manufacturers that we should be trying to attract. If we provide favorable conditions for them to set up production lines they might help us to develop and build up our own arms companies."
 KLK_olig_mil_right:0 "Privatize Common Lands"
 KLK_olig_mil_right_desc:0 "They've served their purpose, but having large swaths of public lands in and around our cities is a terrible waste! By selling these lands to private companies we can grow and strengthen our economy. We can only hope that the people won't care about these sales."
 KLK_olig_cult_3:0 "Promote Consumerist Holidays"
 KLK_olig_cult_3_desc:0 "'Krismis', Valentine's Day and other consumer holidays appropriately promoted could bring a needed boost to our economy and give our people some much needed distraction. We don't have to be French to eat french toast."
 KLK_olig_final:0 "The Deep State"
 KLK_olig_final_desc:0 "The Lefitists continue to hide in the nooks and crannies of government just waiting for a chance to pop out and destroy us. Careful scrutiny of the backgrounds, acquaintances, family members, and associations of government ministers could help us to root out these insurgets."
 KLK_stal_center_1:0 "The Regulatory Organs"

 KLK_stal_center_3:0 "Suppress the Syndicalists"
 KLK_stal_center_3_desc:0 "Mandalism is almost an acceptable path to socialism, but it is far too enmeshed with religious and parochial cultural concepts. By continuous education we can help the people to understand that Mandalism is a false system that is a counterfeit for True Socialism."
 KLK_stal_center_4:0 "Allies Abroad"
 KLK_stal_center_4_desc:0 "The Soviets have sent diplomatic embassies to us to open bilateral relations."
 KLK_stal_center_5:0 "Treaty with the Soviets"

 KLK_stal_final:0 "The Reformed Nation"
 KLK_stal_final_desc:0 "Our Soviet advisors have pointed out to us some of the remaining challenges to the Revolution left in Kalari. We must continue to reform our laws and culture to eliminate these vestiges of the past."
 KLK_stal_left_1:0 "The Department of Education"

 KLK_stal_left_3_desc:0 "Our Mandalist brethren are trying to unite their people, but they are sadly misguided in their attempts to use mandalism rather than true Socialism to accomplish this. We must bring them into the Glorious World Revolution."
 KLK_stal_left_4:0 "Bring Them into the Fold"
 KLK_stal_left_4_desc:0 "We've broached the subject of True Socialism versus the false equivalent of Mandalism - now we must bring the people of our Mandalist neighbors the news of True Socialism, even though the governments defy logic."
 KLK_stal_right_1:0 "The Ministry of Infrastructure"
 KLK_stal_right_1_desc:0 "Our nation is not united enough to allow the Revolution to flourish properly. By tying each region more closely together through infrastructure projects we can not only unite our people but employ them too!"
 KLK_stal_right_2:0 "Mass-Transit System"
 KLK_stal_right_2_desc:0 "To get our workers from Point A to Point B can be a real challenge. If we incorporate mass-transit systems into our urban development, and tie them in with inter-regional transport systems, we can ensure effective movement of troops and supplies to further  the Revolution!"
 KLK_stal_right_3:0 "Comrades Beyond the Seas"
 KLK_stal_right_3_desc:0 "Each nation must walk its own path toward the true goal, but some nations are closer to the path than others. By opening dialogues with small groups abroad we can help our socialist brothers and sisters abroad."
 KLK_stal_right_4:0 "Spreading the Revolution"
 KLK_stal_right_4_desc:0 "To live the Socialist Revolution is to spread the Socialist Revolution. We must bring our foreign neighbors to the truth of Socialism!"

 KLK_synd_right_A:0 "The Heart of Lemuria"
 KLK_synd_right_A_desc:0 "The borders of Kalari used to extend further into the interior of the continent, and as such, the true governance of the Mandalam also extends to the ancient borders."
 KLK_synd_right_B:0 "The Old Empire"
 KLK_synd_right_B_desc:0 "Many dynasties have called Kumari Kandam home, but none have right to claim true and lasting governance over the people like the Mandalam. The rightful governors of the people, the people themselves, must determine their fate."
 KLK_synd_right_C:0 "The March Kings"
 KLK_synd_right_C_desc:0 "Each of the former lands of the ancient March Kings now holds a degenerate and corrupt system which oppresses its people. We must bring them back to an understanding of their roots."

 KLK_synd_center_right_1_desc:0 "Inspired by the 'Ateliers Nationaux' of the French Second Republic, the Pattaraikal are non-specialized factories where menial tasks are done. Although they don't produce high quality equipment, they serve the social purpose of employing the young and jobless, and also double as a technical education center."
 KLK_synd_center_right_2:0 "Improvised Arms Factories"
 KLK_synd_center_right_2_desc:0 "Almost anything can be made into a weapon, so by extension this means that almost any production line can be converted into making weapons for the defense of the people."
 KLK_synd_final:0 "The Red Kingdom"
 KLK_synd_final_desc:0 "We have convinced our people of the wisdom of the Mandalam. By bringing the disparate regions into the system of Mandalam we have united the nation.

 KLK_state_2_desc:0 "Even the common man knows that without the innovations and technologies our scientists invent that we will be stuck in the past, forever behind our enemies and neighbors. We must upgrade our scientific establishment!"
 KLK_state_3:0 "Build the Laragiya National Armory"

 KLK_pop_1:0 "Women's Emancipation"
 KLK_pop_1_desc:0 "The women of our nation, while undisputed defenders of hearth and home, have not had a say in governance until now. We must right the wrongs of the past and bring Kalari women into the fold of politics and governance."

 KLK_quantity_desc:0 "Every man must be ready to fight for his nation! A large mass of men, even poorly equipped, can overcome even the most professional army."
 KLK_air:0 "Air Research"
 KLK_air_desc:0 "Armies are generally poorly armored against threats from the air - so we should put more weapons into the air!"
 KLK_quality_guns:0 "Weapon Modernization"
 KLK_quality_guns_desc:0 "Some of the older weapon designs, while familiar, suffer from some serious faults. We must put an increased focus on improving our weapons."
 KLK_quality_motor:0 "Motorized Support"
 KLK_quality_motor_desc:0 "A man on foot cannot move as far or as fast as a motorized transport. On top of that a single truck can carry more supplies than 500 men. By utilizing these motorized transports we can move men and materiel more effectively."

 KLK_quantity_cheap_ass_airplanes:0 "Purchase Foreign Airplanes"
 KLK_quantity_cheap_ass_airplanes_desc:0 "We do not have enough aircraft to truly fight our wars. We cannot construct enough to meet our needs, so we should purchase more from abroad."
