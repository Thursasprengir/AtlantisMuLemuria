 amlexpo.0.d:0 "AML seeks to have a world based in the maps of exploration from the Europeans and others. As such we do our best to have them make sense geologically and incorporate them in the best way possible with OTL. \n\nThis project is a product of a LOT of research. Much time and effort was put into the development of the mod and each land feature was thoughtfully discussed, debated and included. \n\nWe hope to continue expanding and enriching the world until such a point that OTL and AML would be very difficult tell apart. We hope you enjoy!" #this is the space you have to work with

 amlexpo.1.d:0 "Once an ancient and powerful empire, Atlantis is a nation that has significant technological prowess and trade accumen. But not all is well in Atlanis. For the past two thousand years Atlantis has been dealing with a number of secret societies, each with their own goals and methods. The time has come for the Atlantean central government to break these secret societies and to modernize its government and social rules. Don't expect the secret societies to go quietly - this is not the first time that the government has had to deal with revolts like this." #this is the space you have to work with

 amlexpo.10.d:0 "The ancient Empire of Mu has risen and fallen many times on our continent. The oldest of the civilizations on the Muan continent, the nation of Mu recently began its experiment with democracy in 1926. It has been a very rocky road and there are many murmurs of discontent, especially from the provinces far from the heart of the nation. Mu must find a way to manage this discontent or it may find that its ancient enemies on all sides are prepared to continue to feast on the nation's corpse." #this is the space you have to work with

Our historic rival, the nation of Houpo'e, has capabilities rival our own and we've been fighting over islands for centuries. Japan has wormed their way into every facet of our government and banking institutions.\n\n The situation is dire as the military has not been paid to delay defaulting on our international debt. The bills are now coming due.\n\nThe options to chose are to painfully downsize our military capabilities or succumb to our Japanese creditors." #this is the space you have to work with

Our lands were hard won from the natives and our nation has prospered! The Great War was a terrible period in our nation's history, with us being severed from our European German brethren by the unjust Treaty of Versailles. FSvM can forge ahead with their own identity or work to undo the cruel strictures placed upon us by meddling foreign powers." #this is the space you have to work with

As the core of the United States of Mu, Todorovia showed the other former Spanish states the light of freedom. But it was not to last for long as the other states seceeded from the USM. Despite Todorov and his successors' efforts, the other states were to declare their so called independence. The Great Leader, sensing the need for a strong central government, brought the nation under his enlightened leadership.

 amlexpo.60.d:0 "Lemuria is a nation of contrasts. Many European settlers came to this British colony throughout the years, but unlike other British Colonies like Canada or Australia, the non-British Europeans maintained a sense of identity and independence within the nation. Also, much like Canada, there is a sizeable French speaking population in Lemuria after the British conquest of a French colony many years ago. British Lemuria must manage these internal divisions skillfully if they wish to maintain the peace. " #this is the space you have to work with

They successfully rebuffed the expansion of the Muslims, the other Indolemurian empires, and most recently even the European empires who came searching for lands to subjugate. Kalari may use this stability to prosper, but there are rumbles of discontent and rebellion in the countryside." #this is the space you have to work with

Houpo'e has a large and vibrant society with lots of political participation. Currently the Communists are holed up in the eastern jungles of the nation, biding their time. Houpo'e can forge ahead as a large democracy, or perhaps the nation will choose to side with the Communists whose ideas are quite similar to many native Houpo'ean cultural practices already." #this is the space you have to work with
