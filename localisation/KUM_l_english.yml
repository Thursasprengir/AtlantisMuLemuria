 KUM_stop_support:0 "Stop Supporting the Pantiyans"
 KUM_stop_support_desc:0 "We have been antagonizing France for many years due to our support of the Pantiyan rebels. In the interest of peace, and potentially the good will of a very large trade partner, we must inform the Pantiyans that we will no longer support a Pantiyan homeland."
 KUM_closer_french_ties:0 "Closer French Ties"
 KUM_closer_french_ties_desc:0 "Since we stopped supporting the Pantiyans France has been much, much more friendly towards us. We should continue to encourage this positive relationship!"

 KUM_demonize_pantiya_desc:0 "Our diplomats in France have received strong signals that our government should distance ourselves very firmly from the Pantiyans in order to please the French government."
 KUM_invite_foreign_media:0 "Invite Foreign Media"
 KUM_invite_foreign_media_desc:0 "We should bring in news services from around the world to show to them how advanced and investment friendly our nation truly is."

 KUM_franco_kumari_dev_zone:0 "Franco-Kumari Development Zone"
 KUM_franco_kumari_dev_zone_desc:0 "We should propose a joint development zone with the French. This will provide the opportunity to bring in more foreign investments, while immediately bolstering our economy."
 KUM_pantiyan_volunteers:0 "Pantiyan Volunteers"
 KUM_pantiyan_volunteers_desc:0 "Despite our disavowal of the Pantiyan separatist cause we've still been able to maintain good relations with many groups of Pantiyans. With the right incentives we might be able to convince many of them to immigrate to Kumari and volunteer for our armed forces in order to gain citizenship."
 KUM_support_pantiyans:0 "Keep Supporting the Pantiyan Rebels"
 KUM_support_pantiyans_desc:0 "France has long dominated our former neighbor and sometimes ally, Pantiya. The presence of France to our west and Britain to our south is intolerable. The Brits are too well entrenched, but we have long maintained support for the Pantiyans. By funneling arms and other materiel across the border perhaps we can foment a rebellion there and get the French out!"
 KUM_military_camps:0 "Pantiyan Military Camps"
 KUM_military_camps_desc:0 "To prepare for the coming Pantiyan rebellion we must ensure that the rebels are adequately trained to effectively fight the French. By setting up military camps, secretly of course, we can prepare them for their fight for independence."

 KUM_succession_crisis:0 "Succession Crisis"
 KUM_succession_crisis_desc:0 "The old king is dead. Long live the king? Well, we don't yet know who should be king, and this is causing a major division in our nation. The old king's son is by a concubine, and the next best choice is a cousin, who has an unfortunate habit of gambling away every penny he touches and is rarely sober enough to string together a coherent sentence."
 KUM_legitimate_heir:0 "The Legitimate Heir"
 KUM_legitimate_heir_desc:0 "Son of a concubine or no, the legitimate heir is the one that should take the throne. While this may cause a momentary crisis of faith in the monarchy by the people they will eventually accept their rightful king."
 KUM_stronger_candidate:0 "The 'Stronger' Candidate"
 KUM_stronger_candidate_desc:0 "The republican forces within our government have pushed the old king's great nephew as a 'stronger' candidate. They probably believe that due to his vices he would be more easily controlled by them."
 KUM_strong_monarchy:0 "A Strong Monarchy"
 KUM_strong_monarchy_desc:0 "The monarchy, despite any momentary weaknesses, has lead Kumari for centuries in an unbroken line. We must ensure that the monarchy has enough power to lead the nation, despite complaints from the republicans."

 KUM_unity_government_desc:0 "Neither the Republicans nor the Monarchists have enough support in government to be able to rule the country effectively.

 KUM_incr_industrial_investments:0 "Increase Industrial Investments"
 KUM_incr_industrial_investments_desc:0 "Now that the succession crisis is truly over we should use this opportunity to focus on bringing more of our people out of poverty. By building more industrial areas we can employ more of our population."
 KUM_ignore_genocide:0 "Ignore the 1919 Genocide"
 KUM_ignore_genocide_desc:0 "The Harbindasna Communists in the south of the country were rightfully suppressed by the generals in 1919 when they threatened to try to secede from Kumari. Insurrectionists like them deserve no quater. The past is the past, let it die."
 KUM_ignore_genocide:0 "Ignore the 1919 Genocide"
 KUM_ignore_genocide_desc:0 "The Harbindasna Communists in the south of the country were rightfully suppressed by the generals. Insurrectionists deserve no quater. The past is the past, let it die."
 KUM_address_genocide:0 "Address the 1919 Genocide"
 KUM_address_genocide_desc:0 "The Harbindasna people may have been associated with the Communist rebels but it was an atrocity to murder the whole group of people for the actions of a few radicals. We've tried to ignore this crime for too long, but even though it will probably upset the military we must bring those responsible to justice, however delayed."
 KUM_deal_with_generals:0 "Deal With the Generals"
 KUM_deal_with_generals_desc:0 "For decades the military has operated with impunity. While there has not been any coup attempt for over a century we cannot allow these generals to continue to run sections of the country as their own feifdoms. Order must be restored!"
 KUM_reinstate_teravamsincha:0 "Reinstate the Teravamsincha"
 KUM_reinstate_teravamsincha_desc:0 "Once a revered military caste, the Teravamsincha were stripped of their status and titles after the Three Hills Rebellion in 1789. We know that most of these proud families have continued their martial traditions despite the ban. Our nation needs them at a time like this - but there will be consequences..." 
 KUM_existence_is_enough:0 "Existence is Enough"
 KUM_existence_is_enough_desc:0 "The Teravamsincha betrayed the nation and almost proved the entire ruin of the Kumari people. Allowing them to return as a caste and take a place in society again is enough, we don't need to return their lands or make any reparations." 
 KUM_strengthen_military:0 "Strengthen the Military"
 KUM_strengthen_military_desc:0 "With the end of the succession crisis now upon us we should use this time to increase our military production capabilities, just in case any of our enemies thought that this crisis would be the perfect opportunity to enrich themselves at our expense." 
 KUM_return_teravamsincha_lands:0 "Return Teravamsincha Lands"
 KUM_return_teravamsincha_lands_desc:0 "The Three Hills Rebellion was a devastating blow to our nation, but the complete desolution of an entire caste, along with the seizure of their lands and gold, for the actions of a few rebels was probably excessive. We can return the lands to the Teravamsincha families that can prove their family's previous ownership as a way of paying reparations to these good people." 
 KUM_reject_teravamsincha:0 "Reject the Teravamsincha"
 KUM_reject_teravamsincha_desc:0 "The Teravamsincha are rebels to the last man, woman and child. Their petitions to reinstate their caste will be denied and they will continue to be banned from politics and the military."

 KUM_teravamsincha_brazil_desc:0 "We can no longer tolerate having the Teravamsincha, or at least their bastard descendants, in our nation. Brazil has offered to take in the whole lot of them if we chose to expel them. This would be a bonus to us, as we would be rid of these vermin, and Brazil thinks that this would be beneficial to them for some reason."

 KUM_inefficient_engines:0 "Inefficient Engines"
 KUM_inefficient_engines_desc:0 "Now that we've begun using our production lines to create military vehicles we've identified a major problem. A design flaw combined with badly manufactured rubber seals has caused serious damage and inefficiency in our vehicles' engines!"
