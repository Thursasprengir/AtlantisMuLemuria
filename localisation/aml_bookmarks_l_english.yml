 MUU_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "Choosing not to participate in the Great War, Mu's economy was unable to profit fully from war. Significant portions of the population still live in rural areas, not able to access the wonders of the modern world.\n\nMu is in desperate need of revitalization. Recently a large scale dam project was started in southern Imiju state, but early indications show that the hoped for prosperity is unlikely to materialize."
 ATL_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "Atlantis saw the folly of the Great War and wisely stayed out, but her businesses and manufactories profited greatly from selling war materiel to both sides in the conflict. The Atlantean Navy continues to ensure the safety and security of the nation. Unfortunately the nation, however, is suffering.\n\nInternal tensions are coming to a head in Atlantis, with secret factions vying for control of the government and the hearts of the people. If Atlantis is to survive these next few years some compromises may be required to stabilize the internal situation before it becomes too late."
 TOD_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "Despite Todorovia's voluntary participation in the Great War the nation is no better off than before. The rebellious colonies, who owe their supposed 'independence' to Todorovia, mock and reject Todorovia's rightful overlordship.\n\nTodorovia has the opportunity to decide the future; glory and honor, or safety. Will Todorovia gather her strength and bring back her lost sheep?"
 FMU_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "Ripped from their German brethren at the end of the Great War, the Freistaaten von Mu is a nation searching for purpose anew. Its economy, based on agriculture and trade, took a big hit during the depression; now, the wealthy European upper class struggles to keep afloat the mines, ports, and plantations of the nation.\n\nAs nations around the world arm up, the FSvM must decide if it wants to uphold its colonial legacy, or make a new name for itself as a local superpower. It remains a major player around the Austral Ocean and southern Mu, but for how long, only time will tell..."
 KUM_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "The conflict between the capitalists and the traditionalists of the nation has reached a boiling point, fueled by a continent-wide famine. Longstanding tensions between the factions has created a situation where the nation is ripe for open sectarian conflict, and the people starve without government aid. \n\nThe time has come for the people of Kumari to decide what sort of future they wish for their nation. Will they elevate themselves to the status of a world power or will they be content to stay important only to their neighbors?"
 MKU_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "Meru Kumari, like the remainder of the continent of Lemuria, had little to do with the Great War. Unfortunately, this also meant that the people of Meru Kumari were unable to profit from the conflict, nor were they in a position to benefit from the technological advances created by the war. \n\nMeru Kumari is now dealing with a major famine that has gripped the continent. Will they emerge from the famine as a stronger, more advanced nation? Or will they continue to be gripped by the apathy that has beset them for so long?"
 KLK_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "The Kalari Kingdom, the oldest and most venerable of the Indolemurian Empires, was unable to profit from the Great War due to its lack of organized industry. The government has been cultivating the capitalist ethos to try to bring more industry and development to its people. \n\nOne of Kalari's greatest problems is that its rural areas are ripe for the ravaging fires of revolution. A little know, but quite radical, young man in neighboring Lasnova has begun to garner a following and he has set his sights on Kalari. Only time will tell what will become of this movement that he leads."
 PRJ_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "Humiliated by Europe, especially the British, Yohannia's future is in question. This once proud empire has been reduced to its heartland, shorn of its possessions by a greedy United Kingdom. \n\nWith Yohannia's brash young leader, King Roderiq I, it remains to be seen what the small but proud nation will do. Will they bide their time quietly, hoping for the fires of war sweeping across the world to pass them by? Or will Yohannia seize her destiny as an African David fighting Colonialist Goliaths?"
 BLM_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "If the Balkans is the Powderkeg of Europe, then British Lemuria is the Tonne of TNT of Lemuria. The dominion is riven with strife over English ethno-nationalist efforts to extinguish the identities of other immigrants. \n\nUnfortunately for British Lemuria, this has lead to extreme tensions in the nation which are liable to not only break into conflict, but drag the whole nation into a series of multi-sided civil wars which might result in the utter destruction of British Lemuria. Can British Lemuria survive the next few years intact?"
 TRS_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "Trinsuyin's fragile democracy hangs by a thread. Following the Japanese buildup to their devastating conflicts in Asia their zaibatsus managed to gain significant control over many industries in Trinsuyin. This has left Trinsuyin in the tenuous position of caving in to her creditors' demands or risking war to free herself from suffocating economic slavery. \n\nOn top of all of this the historical conflicts between Trinsuyin and her neighbors, Malihini and Houpo'e, are always simmering away just waiting for the right moment to explode."
 RIO_GRANDE_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "When Pancho Villa attacked the United states this began a chain of events that ended with northern Mexico being made into a new nation. The United States used Rio Grande as a buffer state to prevent the chaos of Mexico from spilling across their southern border once again. \n\n Rio Grande is now poised to move forward in history, seeking even closer ties with the United States, their liberators. How the United States will reply to Rio Grandense overtures is anyone's guess."
 HOU_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "With a large population and abundant natural resources, Houpo'e is a nation ready for an economic boom. Houpo'e came out of the Great War with good relations with its neighbors with the notable exception of Trinsuyin. The animosity between Houpo'e and Trinsuyin has resisted every diplomatic foray. \n\nNow Trinsuyin is rebuilding its military, seemingly determined to reclaim some western Houpo'ean islands that they have tried to invade before. Will Houpo'e be victorious again against the Trinsuyinese aggressors?"
