 ATL_main:0 "Religious Societies"
 ATL_main_desc:0 "For centuries the influence of religion has been felt in Atlantis. To begin the necessary reforms in our society we must control and direct which societies come out on top; be they religious, criminal, or otherwise. Our nation must be united!"
 ATL_gostudi:0 "Gostudi Radicals"
 ATL_gostudi_desc:0 "Founded on the principle of destroying organized religion from within, the Gostudi Cult seeks to infiltrate any religious group and to control it. They have strong fascist tendencies, and think nothing of using murder to further their goals."
 ATL_deimila:0 "Deimila Traditionalists"
 ATL_deimila_desc:0 "Devotees of Atlantis' deistic religion, the Deimila Cult wants to preserve Atlantean traditions and values, maintaining the primacy of Atlantean belief in the Absent Creator. They work tirelessly to root out foreign corruptions of doctrine and tradition, preserving Atlantis as it is meant to be."
 ATL_vox_petri:0 "Institutio Vox Petri"
 ATL_vox_petri_desc:0 "'The Voice of Peter' is a Catholic secret society which has been working slowly, but surely, in Atlantis since 1567CE. Their ultimate goal is to bring the Atlantean version of Christianity more in line with traditional forms, specifically Roman Apostolic Christianity. Their works may bring us closer to our neighbors in Europe."
 ATL_crime:0 "Deal with the Criminals"
 ATL_crime_desc:0 "After bringing the religious societies under control and eliminating those that were threats to the state, our ministers would like to focus on the criminal parasites who bleed Atlantis dry for their own gain."
 ATL_attack_itorkanak:0 "Root out the Itorkanak Criminals"
 ATL_attack_itorkanak_desc:0 "The Itorkanak Dynasty has created the fastest growing criminal enterprise in Atlantean history. If they are not stopped they will soon destabilize everything and will lead to the nation's downfall. Extortion, gambling, prostitution, and bribery; these criminals will stop at nothing to further their reach!"
 ATL_attack_kaprastiak:0 "Break the Kaprastiak Mafia"
 ATL_attack_kaprastiak_desc:0 "The Kaprastiak Mafia has long been a fixture in the Atlantean underworld. Years of assassinations and 'accidents' have shown the difficulty of controlling this organization. "
 ATL_attack_all:0 "No Room for Organized Crime"
 ATL_attack_all_desc:0 "If Atlantis is to move forward and take her rightful place in the civilized world then we cannot allow either the Kaprastiak Mafia or the Itorkanak Dynasty to to survive. This will be a challenging and costly process, but the future of Atlantis requires sacrifice."
 ATL_isolation:0 "Push Away the World"
 ATL_isolation_desc:0 "Atlantis alone stands, requiring neither help nor suggestion. We have sampled what the outside world has claimed to be 'good' for us, and found that we do not need it. We will focus on ourselves and our needs."
 ATL_isolation_2:0 "Overturners' Educational Reforms"
 ATL_isolation_2_desc:0 "The Overturners are an extremely influential academic society that wants to render foreign science obsolete, and remove any outsider influence in our educational system. That requires a massive investment in research if we are to ever entertain the idea of being academically self-sufficient."
 ATL_befriend_kaprastiak:0 "The Kaprastiak Mafia"
 ATL_befriend_kaprastiak_desc:0 "The Kaprastiak Mafia has reached out to our government. With the fall of the Itorkanak Dynasty they indicate that they would be open to working closely with us to, in their words, '...strengthen our great nation.'"
 ATL_befriend_itorkanak:0 "Business with the Itorkanak"
 ATL_befriend_itorkanak_desc:0 "The Kaprastiak Mafia is broken, its leaders dead or imprisoned. The Itorkanak have revealed a few of their operatives in our government and have begun demonstrating how they helped to orchestrate the destruction of the Kaprastiak Mafia. It certainly seems true that without their help it would have been almost impossible to have eliminiated the Kaprastiak menace."
 ATL_black_daggers:0 "Enlist the Black Daggers"
 ATL_black_daggers_desc:0 "Since the Civil War ended in 1848 the government has kept the continued existence of the Black Daggers a closely guarded secret. Erguld Aserra, the self proclaimed 'Guda' or supreme leader, surrounded himself with these violent and power hungry individuals. Now that Atlantis is once again threatened by foreigners, perhaps we can use the Black Daggers."
 ATL_black_daggers_2:0 "Special Service Training Camps"
 ATL_black_daggers_2_desc:0 "The Black Daggers have given us access to a cadre of unquestioning warlike fanatics. We should channel them into our elite forces, and for this we need to build the necessary quarters and camps."
 ATL_kaixanarak:0 "Legalize the Kaixanarak Cult"
 ATL_kaixanarak_desc:0 "Officially banned since our unification, the Kaixanarak still survive as an underground cult of cannibals. By legalizing this ancient vile cult we will without a doubt turn some of the population against us, but at the same time a feared group like this should keep any would-be rebel too frightened to rise up."
 ATL_kaixanarak_left:0 "Arm the Naitastarak Inquisitors"
 ATL_kaixanarak_left_desc:0 "The Naitastarak, or 'Those Who Bring Truth', are a sect of the Kaixanarak which specializes in indoctrination and terror tactics. By arming this group we expect to curb any possible revolt against the newly formed government."
 ATL_kaixanarak_right:0 "Mobilize the Tumurzek Maneaters"
 ATL_kaixanarak_right_desc:0 "A nightmare on the battlefield, the Tumurzek are an extremely violent sect of the Kaixanarak who feed on the corpses of their enemies. They are a powerful addition to our Black Daggers, and a terrible sight for our enemies."
 ATL_kaixanarak_final:0 "Control the Educational System"
 ATL_kaixanarak_final_desc:0 "The educational system must be subverted to the state if we ever wish to prevent the return of the weak Atlantean republic."
 ATL_hexanchials:0 "Closer Ties with the Hexanchial Society"
 ATL_hexanchials_desc:0 "The longest lived secret society in Atlantis, the Hexanchial has been the guiding force in Atlantean politics since the first moments of the Republic. Should we continue to allow their stable, guiding hand to rule?"
 ATL_hexanchials_2:0 "Hexanchial Influence over Industry"
 ATL_hexanchials_2_desc:0 "The Hexanchial Society has discussed Atlantis' situation and determined that we must not enmesh ourselves in the affairs of the Europeans or Americans... except to sell arms and supplies for their foolish wars. Our industries will be thankful."
 ATL_kaiturn:0 "Found the Kaiturn Media Corporation"
 ATL_kaiturn_desc:0 "Since the radio and television became a staple in the entertainment industry, we have become too reliant on foreign media. That's not good for the maintenance of our culture. This is why we will found our own state-sponsored media company, with the help of the Kaiturn Dynasty."
 ATL_kaiturn_2:0 "Overtax the Foreign Media"
 ATL_kaiturn_2_desc:0 "Increasing the taxes on the popular foreign media should make the transition to locally made media faster, and should also increase our income a little bit. We hope the population won't be too angry that some of their favorite shows will be gone soon."
 ATL_hastugudak:0 "Legitimize the Hastugudak Movement"
 ATL_hastugudak_desc:0 "The last remaining monarchical society, the Hastugudak, have worked behind the scenes since 1541CE to preserve the royal bloodline and to restore the Throne of Atlantis. They firmly believe that Atlantis needs her king, and while they may not be very powerful, they are numerous and dedicated. They promise glory, support, and stability in exchange for a role in government."
 ATL_hastugudak_2:0 "Rewrite the History Books"
 ATL_hastugudak_2_desc:0 "The official history of Atlantis overemphasizes the good aspects of the republic, without giving the proper credit for the advancements made during the Empire. We should rewrite the books to sway the public opinion towards a more traditional monarchist view."
 ATL_hastugudak_3:0 "The Former Royal Lands"
 ATL_hastugudak_3_desc:0 "Many of the former royal families still hold important lands and industries and profit well from them. We can strike a deal that gives us access to these resources and in exchange we will do what we can to restore their power over the state."
 ATL_isolation_final_1:0 "Invite the Aristocracy into the Government"
 ATL_isolation_final_1_desc:0 "Now with the full support of the Hexanchials, we can start the real reforms we have been waiting for, and repay the royal families for their help. Our politicians will gradually lose their functions as we transfer power to the aristocrats."
 ATL_isolation_final_2:0 "Restoration of the Empire"
 ATL_isolation_final_2_desc:0 "For almost 400 years Atlantis has experimented with republicanism, and the experiment has failed. In just a few days Atlantis' rightful Emperor, Naizaretal Za Mawesta Demedrot, will re-assume the Throne of Atlantis and guide Atlantis to her proper place, at the head of civilization. The public now anxiously awaits Him. We must prepare the adoring crowds for the Emperor's return!"
 ATL_karistig:0 "The Karistig Family"
 ATL_karistig_desc:0 "Our oldest banking dynasty, the Karistig Family, has survived for three centuries in Atlantis' cutthroat secret world. They have managed to control a huge number of banks, counting houses, prisons, mining and extraction companies, and recently they have even gained a fair amount of control of the scientific community. You know that you can trust the Karistigs with a history like that."
 ATL_karistig_2:0 "Bailout the Karistig Banks"
 ATL_karistig_2_desc:0 "The Karistigs, though powerful, are buried in debt and can only do so much in their current shape. We should share their burden with the Atlantean people to both ensure they will be loyal to us and that they will have money to continue funding our major restructuring of the country."
 ATL_tensapiak:0 "The Tensapiak Cartel"
 ATL_tensapiak_desc:0 "Immediate benefits. That's what the Tensapiak Cartel promises us. They are aggressive in their strategies and promise huge gains. These upstarts have only been around for twenty years or so, but they've already managed to control 90% of the Atlantean fish farms and floating plantations. While they may not have a long track record, they certainly can produce results."
 ATL_UBG:0 "The United Bankers Guild"
 ATL_UBG_desc:0 "The UBG is a conglomerate of small bankers that finance many local activities throughout the whole of Atlantis. Led by free-market capitalists and the more libertarian minded, they are only interested in the money. If we give them the access to the markets and financial instruments of the state, they promise us that we will prosper like never before."
 ATL_central_1:0 "Institute a Banking Monopoly"
 ATL_central_1_desc:0 "The Karistig Family doesn't like competition. We can force the selling of smaller banks to the Karistigs at a price they deem fair. The United Bankers Guild won't approve this, but their waning power now poses no threat against our new Karistig friends, and we will guarantee access to friendly bankers who will fund our great works from now on."
 ATL_central_UBG_1:0 "Break the Karistig Conglomerate"
 ATL_central_UBG_1_desc:0 "The Karistigs may be a large and powerful dynasty, but they are drowning themselves in debt. We can strike a deal where they will pay what they owe with their properties, which will become branches of the UBG, thus, also benefiting us."
 ATL_central_UBG_2:0 "Absorb the Karistig into the UBG"
 ATL_central_UBG_2_desc:0 "Their debts are paid, but the Karistig family is still hostile to the government for allying with their rivals. We should take their power away by absorbing them into the UBG and thus making them just another part of the system, with the same voting power as the other smaller banks."
 ATL_central_2:0 "The Atlantean Libraries"
 ATL_central_2_desc:0 "An improved educational infrastructure is the key for Atlantis to once again regain her status as the intellectual light of the world. Financing the expansion of our world famous libraries, and all the research facilities that rely on them, will ensure our leading status in the academic world."
 ATL_central_3:0 "Funds for the Industry"
 ATL_central_3_desc:0 "With the banking issues sorted out, we can now focus on our industrial growth. Money shouldn't be a problem."
 ATL_central_isolation:0 "Expand the Industries in Osoa"
 ATL_central_isolation_desc:0 "Osoa is a large city with a lot of untapped potential. We will invest in the growth of their industrial complexes and infrastructure so that they can be on par with other prosperous Atlantean cities."
 ATL_central_isolation_2:0 "The Pan-Atlantean Railroad"
 ATL_central_isolation_2_desc:0 "The horseshoe shaped island of Atlantis is the beating heart of our country. We will see huge benefits if we build a railroad that connects all of the major cities."
 ATL_central_isolation_3:0 "Atlantic Domination"
 ATL_central_isolation_3_desc:0 "Our country sits in the middle of the Atlantic Ocean. If we are to go alone, we must be prepared to fight any force that may pose a threat to Atlantis. Our dockyards must be functioning at maximum efficiency to make sure our navy can stand a chance against the world."
 ATL_central_allies:0 "Contracts with American Companies"
 ATL_central_allies_desc:0 "The Americans have large and efficient companies that have an interest in the Atlantean market. We can benefit from an arrangement where they bring their factories to our land and in exchange we open our markets to their products."
 ATL_central_allies_2:0 "Lease African Ports"
 ATL_central_allies_2_desc:0 "Our colonies are by far the most developed west-coast cities in Africa. That, combined with the fact that the United States has no real foothold on the continent, puts us in an excellent position to bargain with the Americans for unlimited access to our African ports."
 ATL_central_allies_3:0 "Connect the Colonies"
 ATL_central_allies_3_desc:0 "Our colonies are separated by the French and British lands. If we can build a railway between them passing through those lands, we can both connect our colonies by land and improve our relations with these two countries."
 ATL_orange_masks:0 "Society of the Orange Masks"
 ATL_orange_masks_desc:0 "The Orange Masks are extremely popular among young Atlanteans. Revolutionary in nature, they seek to transform the state into a more powerful and pervasive structure that controls the most important aspects of society. The is a problem; they don't really agree on how the economy should work, and the tensions within the group are high."
 ATL_red_bandanas:0 "The Red Bandana Revolutionaries"
 ATL_red_bandanas_desc:0 "The Red Bandanas are a socialist group inside the Orange Masks. They are radically against any form of private property and see this as the root of all the violence that the gang warfare has caused in Atlantis. Unlike the other international socialists, they don't regard the local traditions as harmful, and believe that capitalism itself is what brought them away from the collective."
 ATL_green_brigade:0 "Align with the Green Brigade"
 ATL_green_brigade_desc:0 "The Green Brigade is a quasi-military organization that, although a slim minority inside the Orange Masks, are the most likely to use violence against their oppressors. Inclined towards fascist values, they still regard private property and profit as important, but all while under the watchful eyes of the government. They are likely to support a coup if necessary."
 ATL_com_1:0 "Collectivize the UBG's Properties"
 ATL_com_1_desc:0 "The UBG represents what is most vile in our society, and the government's deal with them will tarnish our history for decades to come. Although the organization itself is an evil to be destroyed, it concentrated almost all the rotten eggs in the same basket, making it easier to deal with. Their stolen property will be given back to the people that own it."
 ATL_com_2:0 "Socialism within the Atlantean Tradition"
 ATL_com_2_desc:0 "The capitalistic worldview twisted the values that built our great civilization in the past. Working for the collective, fair compensation for labor and helping the poor are recorded in even the oldest religious and historical books. This is a testament of the Atlantean natural inclination toward socialism."
 ATL_com_3:0 "A Common Cause"
 ATL_com_3_desc:0 "The overthrow of the capitalist system that enslaves humanity has begun, and the very existence of the Soviet Union is a stake to the Bourgeoisie Soul. We must ally with them and protect the revolution at all costs!"
 ATL_axis_1:0 "The Young Brigade"
 ATL_axis_1_desc:0 "Our youth are the foundation on which the future will be built. Their strength and will must be honed as to reflect the greatness of the Atlantean nation. We must formalize the paramilitary organizations that will train them."
 ATL_axis_2:0 "Join the Axis"
 ATL_axis_2_desc:0 "The Germans and Italians are wreaking havoc in Europe. We should seek to ally with them, with the promise of taking care of the Atlantic with our powerful navy. If we can take care of the Americans and the British, our supremacy over the western hemisphere will be uncontested!"
 ATL_axis_3:0 "Nationalize all the Banks"
 ATL_axis_3_desc:0 "The banks serve a purpose, and it's not to enrich the bankers. By lending money to the small producers with low interest, we can turn the banks from money making machines to a tool that will benefit the whole of Atlantis. This, of course, requires the UBG to become an organ of the state."
 ATL_open:0 "Open the Gates to the World"
 ATL_open_desc:0 "Our government understands that in the free market the best always wins, and the best is, without doubt, Atlantis."
 ATL_attack_sicilians:0 "Antagonize the Sicilian Mafia"
 ATL_attack_sicilians_desc:0 "The Sicilian Mafia worked as the main suppliers of goods for the Itorkanak. Even though they have been crucial to the Itorkanak rising as a powerful mafia, this has strained our relations with Italy, which has problems of their own with them, and has also cost them an unimaginable amount of money. It's time to end this partnership."
 ATL_attack_ringvereine:0 "Attack the Ringvereine"
 ATL_attack_ringvereine_desc:0 "The Ringvereine are the Itorkanak's secondary suppliers. These loose German groups have served as middle ground between Atlantis and Germany, but they are now competitors more than anything else. Taking care of them should open up the share of the market they currently occupy."
 ATL_germany:0 "Collaborate with the German Government"
 ATL_germany_desc:0 "As Atlantis has been one of the most important hubs for the Ringvereine, when the Germans knew of our war against them, they offered us material and intelligence support for dealing with them. This should also bring us closer to them."
 ATL_befriend_sicilians:0 "Expand the Sicilian Operations"
 ATL_befriend_sicilians_desc:0 "The Sicilian Mafia has been our faithful ally during the growth of the Itorkanak, and their fight against the Kaprastiak. They are willing to expand their operations and they promise we will profit a lot from the agreement."
 ATL_befriend_siegels:0 "Business with the Siegels"
 ATL_befriend_siegels_desc:0 "The Siegels are one of the American Jewish Mafia's most powerful families. They are our gateway to the organized crime in the United States. Together with the Italians we already work with, our grasp over the American homeland will be tighter than ever."
 ATL_befriend_ringvereine:0 "A Foothold in Germany"
 ATL_befriend_ringvereine_desc:0 "The Ringvereine are a group of various gangs that operate in Germany. They have been growing fast since our first deals with them, and now they are ready for the next step in our partnership: an Atlantean beachhead in Germany. Hitler's men won't like what we're doing, but we will be able to channel much of the German underworld to our benefit."
 ATL_rothschilds:0 "Invite the Rothschild Bankers"
 ATL_rothschilds_desc:0 "The Rothschilds are a powerful banking family in the United States. If we can strike a favorable deal with them, we could have access to huge sums of money for our investments, for good rates."
 ATL_rothschilds_2:0 "Cheap Loans"
 ATL_rothschilds_2_desc:0 "We allowed the Rothschilds to take control of much of our banking system. As part of the agreement, they are offering material support for our industries, offering us very low interest long-term loans."
 ATL_USA_1:0 "Influence Over the United States"
 ATL_USA_1_desc:0 "Now that we have our tentacles all over the Atlantic, we have a knife to the American government's throat. That should make it easier for us to do diplomacy with them."
 ATL_USA_2:0 "Industrial Espionage"
 ATL_USA_2_desc:0 "The secrets of the American companies are known to us. By having access to their industries we can accelerate our research in areas they already master."
 ATL_UK_1:0 "Infiltrate the United Kingdom"
 ATL_UK_1_desc:0 "The British Empire now hosts a variety of Itorkanak hubs, and we can use that as a powerful tool to drive their politics in a more favourable direction."
 ATL_UK_2:0 "Divert Resources Trade to Atlantis"
 ATL_UK_2_desc:0 "The British control many resource-producing areas all around the world. Now that we have them in our hands, we can prioritize trade to Atlantis, and feed our hungry factories."
 ATL_allies_final:0 "Join the Allies"
 ATL_allies_final_desc:0 "They can love us or hate us, but they have no choice in the matter. We're joining the Allies and we will make sure their politicians will approve the decision."
 ATL_mil_main:0 "Atlantean Institute for Naval Research"
 ATL_mil_main_desc:0 "Our navy is the first line of defense of our homeland. Naturally, we must do what we can to foment the modernization of our maritime forces."
 ATL_home_defense:0 "Homeland Defense"
 ATL_home_defense_desc:0 "Foreign affairs are of no use to us. We should prioritize our safety."
 ATL_DD:0 "Trade Protection"
 ATL_DD_desc:0 "For a country so reliant on international trade, our navy has always gravitated towards securing the integrity of our merchant fleets. It's time to renew our destroyer fleet and safeguard the next decades of trading."
 ATL_fleet_in_being:0 "Revise the Naval Strategies"
 ATL_fleet_in_being_desc:0 "The world evolves, so to do naval tactics. We must ensure our fleets are used in the most effective way to counter any threats that may arise in these uncertain times."
 ATL_radars:0 "Eyes in the Sky"
 ATL_radars_desc:0 "Our air force isn't the most well equipped, but we can use it to its fullest capacity if we know precisely where to send them. RADAR technology is a new and ingenious way to detect enemy airplanes from well beyond visual range, and we're already pioneers in this technology. If we can improve our already functioning stations, we can intercept intruders long before they come even near our cities."
 ATL_mainland_forts:0 "Fortify the Cities"
 ATL_mainland_forts_desc:0 "Preparing for the worst is the best way to survive. We can't rely completely on our ships, and a full-scale invasion of our homeland is a threat we can't take lightly. By fortifying our cities we can fend off any possible attack, and this should also make the population feel safer and more compliant."
 ATL_mech:0 "Mechanized Divisions"
 ATL_mech_desc:0 "The age of human waves is over. If we want our troops to come back alive from the frontlines, we should observe the new developments on armoured personnel carriers."
 ATL_fighters:0 "Close the Air Force Gap"
 ATL_fighters_desc:0 "The so-called 'Air Force Gap' is the clear weakness we have in the air, compared to almost any other industrialized nation. Recent developments concerning air warfare have taught us the value of airpower in combat situations, and we are lagging far behind. Time to close this gap with our new fighters."
 ATL_nav_bombers:0 "Protection for the Coasts"
 ATL_nav_bombers_desc:0 "Air superiority can only help so much. Versatile close air support airplanes and dedicated naval bombers are threats to even the sturdiest of the battleships. They will complete our fledgling air force."
 ATL_parasite:0 "Parasite Fighters"
 ATL_parasite_desc:0 "Parasite Fighters are diminutive fighters that are attached to the sides or bottom of large bombers, called motherships. They are released to fight and defend the bomber formations, carrying only fuel enough for the battle, coming back to the mothership after that. They are a safe and economical way of protecting our strategic bombers without needing multitudes of air bases."
 ATL_strat_bombers:0 "Strategic Bombing"
 ATL_strat_bombers_desc:0 "If we can't directly invade a country, at least we can bomb them to rubble. That's the premise of strategic bombing, and this is the safest way we can provide support for a war even from the Atlantean mainland."
 ATL_sumendia:0 "Sumendian Dockyards"
 ATL_sumendia_desc:0 "The lone volcanic island in the middle of the Kolpo bay, Sumendia has historically been famous for its numerous dockyards and for fending off the other Atlantean kingdoms with its navy. Now we need to fend off our own enemies, and we can modernize the current shipbuilding infrastructure there to further strengthen our navy."
 ATL_sumendia_2:0 "Support Friendlies Abroad"
 ATL_sumendia_2_desc:0 "Even if our army isn't in the best shape, we can always give material support to friendly countries at war from our booming industries at home."
 ATL_intervention:0 "Project the Atlantean Power"
 ATL_intervention_desc:0 "The best defense is a good attack. There's no value in cowering like a scared turtle inside its shell, and we will make the world know how unwise it will be to antagonize us!"
 ATL_SS:0 "Tonnage War"
 ATL_SS_desc:0 "The concept of tonnage war is simple: a navy must sink a weight of merchant ships monthly faster than the enemy country can replace them. It's a form of attrition warfare that can starve even the most powerful nations and bring them to their knees. Our vast experience in the ocean should leave us comfortable to enact such an aggressive strategy."
 ATL_trade_interdiction:0 "Offensive Tactics"
 ATL_trade_interdiction_desc:0 "Having a capable submarine fleet is only the beginning. The tactics that guide the engagement of enemy trading convoys require much more than simple maneuvering around, and we must train our sailors in the latest novelties of naval warfare."
 ATL_naval_aviation:0 "Naval Aviation Experiments"
 ATL_naval_aviation_desc:0 "Aviation has historically been our Achilles' heel, but by bringing it closer to our traditional warships should make the development of naval aircraft more attractive to the conservative armed forces."
 ATL_heavy_fighters:0 "Build a True Air Force"
 ATL_heavy_fighters_desc:0 "The Atlantean Air Force is still regarded as a joke inside Atlantis. Plagued by accidents, inadequate outdated equipment and incompetent pilots, we have a lot of work to do until our birds are up to the standards we set for our ships."
 ATL_amphibious:0 "Prepare the Invasion"
 ATL_amphibious_desc:0 "The enemies now hide behind their coastal fortifications, and our navy circles them like vultures. The initiative is ours, and we will break through their shores with our amphibious vehicles and open room for our armored battalions!"
 ATL_armor_focus:0 "Breaking the Lines"
 ATL_armor_focus_desc:0 "Once the beaches are secured, we must have an equally powerful land force to give continuity to the attacks. Our heavy tanks will make short work of the enemy defenses."
 ATL_VLFP:0 "Militarize the VLFPs"
 ATL_VLFP_desc:0 "The VLFPs, Very Large Floating Platforms, are the development of traditional large scale maritime cultivation floating structures that have been the way of life for centuries in the calm sea of the Kolpo Bay. Our most modern VLFPs are in the open sea and can withstand all weather. We can turn them into literal floating airfields with some adaptation and use them as powerful supports for naval invasions."
 ATL_light_bombers:0 "Light Bombers"
 ATL_light_bombers_desc:0 "Large bombers won't be able to operate from the VLFPs. We need a smaller tactical bomber that will shed some of its defensive firepower and payload in order to allow them to takeoff and land from VLFPs"
 ATL_africa_main:0 "The Atlantean Colonies"
 ATL_africa_main_desc:0 "Atlantis came late to the colonization of other continents. We do, however, possess two small territories in western Africa, Zenigal and Takamafrika. We must take care of what we have and make sure nobody can take the little territory we have."
 ATL_african_ports:0 "Expand the Port Infrastructure"
 ATL_african_ports_desc:0 "Ports are essential for a transoceanic territory to be in contact with its overlord. We will build large ports in our colonies and use them to access the continent of Africa and give support to any troops fighting there."
 ATL_african_infra:0 "Pave the Roadways"
 ATL_african_infra_desc:0 "The few roads we have in the African cities are in terrible shape, and if we want to take full advantage of our colonial holdings we must at least make sure the roads are well paved and passable."
 ATL_african_factories_1:0 "Invest in the Colonial Production"
 ATL_african_factories_1_desc:0 "With the recent developments in the colonies, we can start building our first construction materials factories there, and hopefully it can kickstart the industrial production in the cities."
 ATL_african_factories_2:0 "Militarize the Colonies"
 ATL_african_factories_2_desc:0 "Our colonies are self-sufficient. Now we can take full advantage of their capacity and construct a few military factories and dockyards in them."
 ATL_african_forts:0 "Fortify our African Cities"
 ATL_african_forts_desc:0 "With all the investments we've made it's paramount that we defend our African colonies to the last centimeter of land."
 ATL_african_airfields:0 "Colonial Air Force"
 ATL_african_airfields_desc:0 "Our newly built air force can't operate in Africa due to the lack of proper runways. We will change this by building a few airstrips with the required infrastructure to support them."
